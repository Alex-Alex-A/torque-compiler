# torque-compiler

I assembled distinct torque comiler using Visual Studio 2019, under Windows 10. Source files are taken from here: https://github.com/v8/v8/tree/main/src/torque

There's a problem when I start the compiled programm like this: 

    torque test-torque.tq

I have an error: 'test-torque.tq:221:1: Torque Error: cannot find "Context"'

Sample file test-torque.tq is taken from here:  https://github.com/v8/v8/tree/main/test/torque

Does anybody have an idea what is it?
